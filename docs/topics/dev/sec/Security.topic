            <b>DevSecOps</b> extends the principles of DevOps by integrating security practices into the development and
            operations processes.
            The goal is to make security a shared responsibility throughout the entire lifecycle of
            applications and infrastructure.
            The core principles of DevSecOps include:
        </p>
        <list>
            <li><b>Shift-Left Security:</b> Incorporate security practices early in the development process, rather than
                waiting until the end.
            </li>
            <li><b>Compliance as Code:</b> Define and enforce security policies and compliance requirements using code.
            </li>
            <li><b>Security Automation:</b> Automate security testing and compliance checks within the CI/CD pipeline.
                Automated build tools compile the code, run unit tests, and perform <b>static code analysis</b> for security
                vulnerabilities.
                Automated testing frameworks run integration, end-to-end, and <b>security tests</b> (e.g.,
                vulnerability scanning, penetration testing).
                Deployment scripts or tools deploy the application to staging
                or production environments, with <b>security checks in place</b>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Continuous Monitoring:</b> Continuously monitor for security vulnerabilities and threats in both
                applications and infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li><b>Collaboration:</b> Foster collaboration between development, operations, and security teams to ensure
                security is a shared responsibility.
            </li>
        </list>
