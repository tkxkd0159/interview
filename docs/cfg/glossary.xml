        Modems also operate at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. Modems also use MAC addresses to control access to the
        network medium. Modems are used to connect a local network (LAN) to a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet. Modems often
        implement flow control mechanisms to regulate the flow of data between the local network and the wide area network.
